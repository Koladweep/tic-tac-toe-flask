        <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game Documentation</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Overview
                <ul>
                    <li>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, player Vs. A.I. game, where both take turns placing their symbols(X and
                        O) on a 3x3 grid.</li>
                    <li>First mover is decided by a toss</li>
                    <li>Whoever succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a <u>row</u>, <u>column</u>, or
                        <u>diagonal</u> wins the game.</li> 
                    </ul>

            </li>
            <li>Implementation Details 
                <p>The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The HTML code defines the structure of the page, including-
                        <ul>
                            <li>the game board,</li>
                            <li>buttons for resetting the game and changing difficulty levels,</li>
                            <li>and elements for displaying messages to the player.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The CSS code defines the styles for these elements, such as their <u>size</u>, <u>position</u>, and
                        <u>color</u>.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript code defines the game's logic and behavior, such as how to handle player moves, check
                        for a win or draw, and reset the game.</li>
                        <p>source code: <a href= "https://github.com/Koladweep/tic-tac-toe-flask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Koladweep/tic-tac-toe-flask</a></p>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Features
                <p>One of the key features of this game is its AI opponent, which uses different heuristics and
                    algorithms to determine its moves depending on the selected difficulty level.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>At the "easy" level, the AI chooses a random available cell.</li>
                    <li>At the "medium" level, it tries to choose the center or a corner cell if available (This
                        increases the probability of winning).</li>
                    <li>At the "tough" level, it uses a simplified version of the minimax algorithm to simulate all
                        possible moves and outcomes and choose a move that maximizes its chances of winning while
                        minimizing its chances of losing by <b>even trying to block the Player from winning.üòÉ</b></li>
                    <li>The game cannot start without a toss and you cannot back out once it begins üòàüî±.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Behavior
                <p>The game's behavior is controlled by several variables and functions defined in the JavaScript code.
                    When the user clicks on a cell in the game board or on one of the buttons (e.g., reset or toss), an
                    event listener function is called that updates the game state and HTML elements accordingly.</p>
                <p>For example, when a player clicks on an empty cell in the game board, the `playerMove` function is
                    called. This function updates the content of the clicked cell to show the current player's symbol
                    (always "X") and checks if the current player has won or if there is a tie. If neither of these
                    conditions is met, it switches to the other player (the computer) and calls the `computerMove`
                    function.</p>
                <p><b>The `computerMove` function uses different heuristics to determine its move depending on the
                        selected difficulty level (as described above). Once it has chosen a move, it updates the
                        corresponding cell in the game board with its symbol (always "O") and checks if it has won or if
                        there is a tie.</b></p>
                <p>Overall, the game's behavior is determined by a combination of user interactions (e.g., clicking
                    on cells or buttons) and internal logic (e.g., checking for wins or ties) implemented in
                    JavaScript.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Credits
                <p><b>First credits go to my parents and to my superiors, and preceptors. I offer them my respects. I cannot be
                    anything without their grace.</b></p>
                <p><b>Tailored with the help of:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>ChatGPT 3.5: </b>The friendly developer copilot and the interactive developer book that will
                        finally make you feel "It's time I read documentation. It helps when you get to see before you read.</li>
                    <li><b>Microsoft Bing: </b>All the JavaScript and logic was developed by the Bing Chatbot that is built
                        on ChatGPT-4.</li>
                    <li><b>Mozilla Developers Network:</b> I found this resource directly and indirectly very helpful
                        in learning HTML, CSS, colors (learning), and <u>project ideation</u> (I'm now learning to do this before
                        getting into the tech). MDN got me started with web development.</li>
                    <li><b>Github Copilot:</b> Latest. It helped me reformat the documentation from it's messy form to a
                        more readable and found the glitch in the list nesting. I like this tool.</li>
                        <li><b>HTML Preview v0.2.5 by George Oliveira:</b> A really helpful VSCode plugin that could've saved me so much time had I used it earlier. It's a great tool to preview your HTML files in the browser without having to save them first. Remembering the past experience with that kind of stuff while testing this game, I was unwilling to fix this documentation, had I not tried these tools.</li>
